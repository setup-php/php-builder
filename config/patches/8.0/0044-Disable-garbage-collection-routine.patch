Subject: Disable GC in ini files

Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=831752
Bug-Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/php7.3/+bug/1772915
Forwarded: not-needed
Last-Update: 2024-01-19

This is disabled in the Debian packages due to the strict permissions on
/var/lib/php. Instead, GC is performed through /etc/cron.d/php, which uses the
session.gc_maxlifetime setting.
