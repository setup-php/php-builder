+# Sources
 
-# The PHP Interpreter
+This is a fork of the official PHP repository which receives backport of security fixes from maintained branches.
 
-PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to
-web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your
-blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the
-[PHP License v3.01](LICENSE).
+This branch is **PHP version 8.0.30** with security fixes (see the NEWS file).

+# Binary distributions
 
-## Documentation
+Known list of providers using this repository as sources for build of old PHP version with extended security support:
 
-The PHP manual is available at [php.net/docs](https://php.net/docs).
+## RPM
 
-## Installation
+### Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / AlmaLinux / RockyLinux
 
-### Prebuilt packages and binaries
+* [Remi's RPM repository](https://rpms.remirepo.net/)
 
-Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.
+## DEB
 
-For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from
-[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the
-`*.exe` files are ready to use.
+### Debian / Ubuntu
 
-For other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://php.net/install).
-
-### Building PHP source code
-
-*For Windows, see [Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).*
-
-For a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For
-a default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3. On Ubuntu,
-you can install these using:
-
-    sudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c \
-                        libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev
-
-Generate configure:
-
-    ./buildconf
-
-Configure your build. `--enable-debug` is recommended for development, see
-`./configure --help` for a full list of options.
-
-    # For development
-    ./configure --enable-debug
-    # For production
-    ./configure
-
-Build PHP. To speed up the build, specify the maximum number of jobs using `-j`:
-
-    make -j4
-
-The number of jobs should usually match the number of available cores, which
-can be determined using `nproc`.
-
-## Testing PHP source code
-
-PHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command `make test` is used after
-successful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.
-
-It is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting `-jN` in
-`TEST_PHP_ARGS`:
-
-    make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test
-
-Shall run `make test` with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum
-number of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.
-
-The [qa.php.net](https://qa.php.net) site provides more detailed info about
-testing and quality assurance.
-
-## Installing PHP built from source
-
-After a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with:
-
-    make install
-
-Depending on your permissions and prefix, `make install` may need super user
-permissions.
-
-## PHP extensions
-
-Extensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many
-essential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP
-Extension Community Library - [PECL](https://pecl.php.net).
-
-## Contributing
-
-The PHP source code is located in the Git repository at
-[github.com/php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src). Contributions are most
-welcome by forking the repository and sending a pull request.
-
-Discussions are done on GitHub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed
-to the official PHP developer mailing list internals@lists.php.net.
-
-New features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See
-[Request for comments - RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc) and
-[Voting on PHP features](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting) for more information
-on the process.
-
-Bug fixes don't require an RFC. If the bug has a GitHub issue, reference it in
-the commit message using `GH-NNNNNN`. Use `#NNNNNN` for tickets in the old
-[bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net) bug tracker.
-
-    Fix GH-7815: php_uname doesn't recognise latest Windows versions
-    Fix #55371: get_magic_quotes_gpc() throws deprecation warning
